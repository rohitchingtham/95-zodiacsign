        <i><b>Cancer Zodiac Sign Traits</b></i><br><br><br>
        Emotional, intuitive, and practically psychic; ruled by the moon and characterized by the crab,
        Cancer has so much going on in its watery depths. Cancer signs may seem prickly and standoffish 
        at first meeting,once they make the decision to become friends with someone, that person has a
        friend for lifeMost Cancer signs have been called psychic at some point, and with good reason—Cancer
        can often intuit relationships, ideas, and motivations before anyone has actually spoken. That can
        make for challenging interactions with this sign—Cancer hates small talk, especially when it 
        contains white lies (like saying, "How nice to see you!" when it's clear that both parties would 
        rather avoid each other). That's why social gatherings can be overwhelming for Cancers. 
        They'd much rather spend time in small groups where everyone is on the same page.<br><br>
