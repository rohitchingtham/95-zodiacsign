        Independent and enigmatical, Aquarians are unique. There is no one quite like an Aquarius,
        and because each is so incredibly individual, it can be tough to describe them as a group. 
        Aquarians don't like labels, and may shy away from any adjectiveâ€”even the good ones you might 
        bestow upon them. Aquarians believe in the nature of change and evolution, and even though they're 
        a fixed sign,they may not necessarily believe they are the "same" people they were when they 
        were born.<br><br>
