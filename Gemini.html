        <i><b> Gemini Zodiac Sign Traits</b></i><br><br><br>
         Smart, passionate, and dynamic, Gemini is characterized by the Twins, Castor and Pollux,
         and is known for having two different sides they can display to the world. Expert communicators,
         Gemini is the chameleon of the Zodiac, adept at blending into different groups based on the vibe
         and energy they perceive. While they're also amazing at showcasing surface traits, the Gemini well 
         runs deep, which is why the Twins are one of the Zodiac's most emotionally intelligent signs.<br><br>
