        <i><b>Taurus Zodiac Sign Traits</b></i><br><br><br>
        Smart, ambitious, and trustworthy, Taurus is the anchor of the Zodiac.
        Amazing friends, colleagues, and partners, Taureans value honesty above
        all else and are proud that their personal relationships tend to be drama
        free. 
        
        Bulls get the reputation of being stubborn, but they're not always stuck 
        in their ways. This searching sign is willing to see another point of view, but 
        they won't flip-flop on an opinion just to make someone else happy. They will shift
        their thinking only if they truly have a change of heart.<br><br>
