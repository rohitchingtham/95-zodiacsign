        <i><b>Libra Zodiac Sign</b></i><br><br><br>
        Intelligent, kind, and always willing to put others before themselves, Libras value harmony in all
        forms. Ruled by Venus, the planet of beauty, Libra adores a life that looks good. As the master of 
        compromise and diplomacy, Libra is adept at seeing all points of view, and excels at crafting compr
        omises and effecting mediation between others. This sign has a rich inner life yet loves other 
        people, and they're always happiest with  a large group of friends, family, and coworkers on
        whom they can count.<br><br>
