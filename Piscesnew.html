        <i><b>Pisces Zodiac Sign Traits</b></i><br><br><br>
        Smart, creative, and deeply intuitive, Pisces can be close to psychic. Pisces feel things 
        deeply, and have incredibly strong gut reactions. A Pisces "knows" things from deep within,
        and can often judge whether a person or situation is good or bad. That doesn't mean a Pisces 
        ignores the logical part of their brain, though. Deeply intelligent, Pisces have a profound
        respect for the power of the human mind. Is it a surprise that Albert Einstein was a Pisces?

        Pisces signs are sensitive, and get along well in small groups of people. Sometimes, a Pisces may 
        feel like they have an internal and external self, and they may need to spend a lot of time solo to
        recalibrate those two halves of themselves. A Pisces is rarely lonely when they are by themselves,
        and have an active imagination. Creative, Pisces love spending time reading,exploring or creating 
        art or music, and understanding their emotions through art.<br><br>
