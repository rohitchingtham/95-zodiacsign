        <i><b> Leo Zodiac Sign Traits </b></i><br><br><br>
        Bold, intelligent, warm, and courageous, fire sign Leo is a natural leader of the Zodiac,
        ready to blaze a trail, vanquish injustice, and make a name for themselves along the way. 
        Blessed with high self-esteem, Lions know that they possess enviable traitsâ€”and they're proud 
        of them. They don't believe in false modesty and will be the first to praise themselves for a 
        job well done. But Leo isn't self-aggrandizing or unwilling to roll up those sleeves and do the 
        work: this sign knows that in order to be respected and admired,
        he or she needs to put in the effort worthy of a leader.<br><br><br>
